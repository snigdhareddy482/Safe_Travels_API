-We will probably need to add a helper function for the route API to get multiple long and lat points. This is because the crimeo api searches based on the long and lat points in a radius, which will probably be a few miles. 
     -hmmmm, what if we miss a high crime area based on that?

-We will FOR SURE need to add a helper function to the crimeo tool in order to get the current date. The start date will be the current date, and the end date will be 6 months or a year ago from the current date
